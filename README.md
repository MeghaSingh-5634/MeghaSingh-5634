### About Me
Enthusiastic and adaptable individual with a keen interest in machine learning and a strong command of Java for Data Structures and Algorithms. I've had the pleasure of working on various projects that allowed me to explore and implement machine learning models, gaining valuable insights along the way. Currently seeking internship opportunities to further hone my skills in these domains.
### What I love to do??
ðŸŽ¨ I love doing crafty projects and preserving waste materials, always hopeful they'll find a creative use in the future. Making the best out of waste is my specialty!
